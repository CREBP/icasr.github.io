ICASR website
===

This is the source for the ICASR website. It is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Pages can be formatted using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

The front page is `index.md` and blog posts are placed under `_posts` and must adhere to the naming scheme `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title-words.md`. Each page or post must start with [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), such as:

```
---
layout: default
title: My Page
---
```
